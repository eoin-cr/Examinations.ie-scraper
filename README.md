# Examinations.ie Scraper
I don't even need to use this website anymore as I've finished the LC but it pissed me off so much, so when I was looking for something to code I thought I might be able to improve it.

I have created a python flask webserver so now a website version of the
code can be run, which should be handier than using the command line.

You can access the scraper at https://examinations.eoin-cr.xyz/ .  It 
should be fully functional now  (and in my opinion is nicer to use than
the examinations.ie website)
