# Examinations.ie Scraper
Even though I don't need to use this website anymore, when I did have to use it for the Leaving Cert, I found it 
incredibly annoying to use, so I'm writing this program in the hopes other people find it helpful.

I have created a python flask webserver so now a website version of the
code can be run, which should be handier than using the command line.

You can access the scraper at https://examinations.eoin-cr.xyz/ (unfortunately my server is currently down,
but feel free to host your own version of the site).  It should be fully functional now (and in my opinion is nicer 
to use than the examinations.ie website)
