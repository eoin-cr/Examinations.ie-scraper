# Examinations.ie Scraper
I don't even need to use this website anymore as I've finished the LC but it pissed me off so much, so when I was looking for something to code I thought I might be able to improve it.

I have created a python flask webserver so now a website version of the
code can be run, which should be handier than using the command line.

Note: The inputs are reset every time the form is submitted.  I understand
this will get annoying so I'm working on fixing it
